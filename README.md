# ðŸš¢ Titanic Prediction

## Project Overview
The Titanic Prediction project is a machine learning application designed to predict passenger survival on the Titanic based on historical data. Using classification algorithms and extensive feature engineering, the project aims to demonstrate the power of predictive analytics in solving real-world problems.

## Key Features
- **Data Preprocessing:** Automated cleaning, feature engineering, and handling of missing values to prepare the Titanic dataset for modeling.
- **Classification Models:** Implementation of various machine learning algorithms (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forests) to predict survival outcomes.
- **Model Evaluation:** Uses performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score to evaluate model performance.
- **Interactive Dashboard:** A Streamlit-based interface that allows users to adjust model parameters, view predictions, and visualize results.
- **Insightful Visualizations:** Charts and graphs that illustrate the distribution of features and the effectiveness of the predictive models.

## Technologies & Tools
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Data Processing:** Pandas, NumPy
- **Machine Learning:** Scikit-learn, TensorFlow/Keras (if applicable)
- **Visualization:** Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly
- **Web Framework:** Streamlit
- **Version Control:** Git, GitHub
